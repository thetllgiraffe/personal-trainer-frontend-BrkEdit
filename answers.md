# Project Fixes

Here is a summary of the key fixes implemented to restore and improve the application's functionality:

### 1. Dependency Management

- **Action:** Resolved package errors by installing all required packages.
- **Outcome:** Ensured the application could build and run without dependency crashes.

### 2. Component Restoration

- **Action:** Re-enabled core functionality by uncommenting previously disabled import statements in `page.tsx`.
- **Outcome:** Restored essential components to the main page.

### 3. Asset Correction

- **Action:** Corrected broken image URLs within the `page.tsx` file.
- **Outcome:** Ensured all visual assets and images render correctly for users.

### 4. Critical Layout Correction

- **Action:** Addressed a major rendering bug where the entire page was invisible due to a `display: none` style on the `<body>` tag in global.css.
- **Outcome:** The application is now visible and accessible to users.

### 5. Navbar Styling and Behavior

- **Action:** Fixed the navigation bar's disappearing behavior on scroll by applying `position: fixed`. Implemented `display: flex` in the `<navbar>` tag and `<container>` tag respectively for proper item alignment in `navbar.module.css` .
- **Outcome:** The navbar is now permanently visible and correctly formatted, improving site navigation.

### 6. Code Refactoring

- **Action:** Eliminated a persistent error by deleting the redundant `layout.client.tsx` file.
- **Outcome:** Streamlined the codebase and removed a source of bugs.

### 7. Regression Testing

- **Action:** Performed a thorough functionality check after implementing the fixes.
- **Outcome:** Confirmed that core features, including user login and the booking system, remain fully operational.
